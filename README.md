## Signal Strength Quality
## To build a machine learning model which can help the company to predict the equipment’s signal quality using various parameters. 

**• DOMAIN:** Electronics and Telecommunication
.

**• OBJECTIVE**:

To build a regressor to determine the signal strength or quality.

**• DATA DESCRIPTION:**

The data set contains information on various signal tests performed:
1. Parameters: Various measurable signal parameters.
2. Signal_Quality: Final signal strength or quality


 **• Steps and tasks:**
1. Import data.
2. Data analysis & visualisation
    - Perform relevant and detailed statistical analysis on the data.
3. Design, train, tune and test a neural network regressor.
4. Pickle the model for future use.
